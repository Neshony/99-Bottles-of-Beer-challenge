99-Bottles-of-Beer-challenge

This is the code I came across when I was doing the challenge.
My point was, even though I believe it's amazing when someone can write much shorter code,
why would that matter if code doesn't do exactly what it suppose to do.

Anyway, I am a beginner and I am writing this mostly for myself,
but if you came across it feel free to comment and/or suggest. :)
